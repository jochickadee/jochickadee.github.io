		  <h1>Week Four</h1>
		  <h2>Ruby Intro &ndash; Arrays and Hashes</h2>
		  <h4>December, 7th 2015</h4>

		  <section>
		  	<h4>Warning: this blog contains painfully brutal honesty and self-reflection along with tech talk. Cheers!</h4>
		    <p>Week four. This was an interesting week for me. I started off feeling good - got my time management plan going, got one of my discussion posts done early, reading Chris Pine's programming book and doing the exercises in it plus our weekly challenges. Everythings moving along great. Then BOOM! I'm totally lost. But we'll get to that. Onto the real reason for this blog post - arrays and hashes.</h4>
		    <p>Arrays and hashses are two different ways of storing data in Ruby that you can access later in your program. Arrays are an ordered list of values (or items). For example here's a list of my pets in an array: 
	    	<pre><code>
	    		pet_array = ["Stupido", "Sarone", "Maximus", "J&ouml;rmungandr"]
	    	</code></pre>
		    See, just a list of my pets names. But there is an order to this list. Stupido is first so to access him you would use the index 0 (in programming, you start with 0 rather than 1), Sarone is next to he's number 1, Maximus is number 3 and so on down the line. Now hashes are a little different. Hashes store information in pairs. So for this example I would have what kind of animal each pet is and then the name with it. Example:
	    	<pre><code>
	    		pet_hash = {
	    		cat => "Stupido",
	    		ball_python1 => "Sarone",
	    		boa_constrictor => "Maximus",
	    		ball_python2 => "J&ouml;rmungandr"
	    		}
	    	</code></pre>
	    	With a hash you can get different information based on what you ask. "Hey hash, how many pets do I have?" "4"; "Hey hash, what's my boa constrictors name?" "Maximus" and so on. 
		    </p>
		    <p>Back to my panic attack weekend. I think scheduled my pairing session way to early and was pretty lost. Went back to the books and then tried the solo challenge and couldn't figure out three of the parts of the challenge. Add another bad pairing session and I'm FREAKING OUT! Panic attacks and ugly crying. 'I can't even put into words what the problem is. OH gods, I've made a terrible mistake, what am I EVEN DOING!?' I stopped. Put the laptop down and backed away slowly. I slept on it and worked on a gameplan to get over this hump. First, what's my problem? Where am I getting stuck? Everything between the <code>def</code> &amp; <code>end</code> tags. Ok, well shit.. So my problem is either 1. I don't get what is being asked of me. (This almost always happens if it's a math question. I'm terrible at math. WTF is factoring again? or 2. I understand what's being asked and I don't know how to translate that into code. (Ok, return the shortest string in an array. Got it. Now.. how do I do that?) So that's pretty much where I am right now. Flip-flopping between "I got this!" and "Oh f$&amp;% - I don't got this!" But I've got my books, I've got Codecademy &amp; Team Treehouse, and office hours with guides, (SO hitting that up tonight!) and I'm gonna figure this out! Wish me luck!</p>
