How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
To be honest, for me it was a tad bit awkward at first. I can be bit of a 
control freak and I'm used to creating things on my own so it was a new experience having someone else's input to consider.
As with the Berkshire site challenge it was nice to have another pair of eyes on 
the code but with this challenge we were designing the site together as opposed to just coding what we were given. In the end we went a different direction than I 
would have chosen myself, but I am totally happy with the result and I feel we worked together well. 

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
I love wireframing! I find it incredibly helpful to plan and make a blue print first so you have a solid idea of what needs to be done and how you're going to do it. I think it makes work easier and flow much smoother. I like to draw out the initial wireframe and then use a program like Adobe Illustrator to detail and fine turn the wireframe. I think it's refreshing and a lot of fun to step away from the computer and draw out your design ideas on pen and paper as opposed to using a software like Balsamiq. But the graphic designer in me will never pass up an opportunity to use Adobe.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
We are both pretty visual people and we ended up using a online wireframe tool that my pair suggested where we could quickly and easily layout our elements and give them some very basic grey styling to help flesh out the wireframe.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
We decided to give the <nav> tag a try for our sidebar navigation element. The <nav> tags is new to HTML 5 and tells the browser that the content inside are specifically navigation links. 

Then, add a link to your wireframe image so your reviewers can see what it looks like:
