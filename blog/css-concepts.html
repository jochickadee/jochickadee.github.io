		  <h1>Weeks Two and Three</h1>
		  <h2>HTML &amp; CSS!</h2>
		  <h4>November, 29th 2015</h4>

		  <section>
		    <p>Weeks two and three in the bag! I feel like I'm getting into the swing of Phase 0. The last two weeks we've been learning HTML and CSS. HTML is like the skeleton of a website and CSS is like the skin. With CSS you can style the HTML elements and position them in whatever layout you design. I'm going to go over positioning in CSS because frankly, I totally didn't get it! Quick CSS lesson - you use the selector to say which HTML element you'd like to style and then the declaration code block to tell the browser how to style that element.</p><img src="../imgs/csssyntax.png" alt="An image showing the CSS syntax">

		    <h4>Positioning in CSS</h4>
		    <p>You can use the position property to position elements on a page. To do this you set the position property and then give direction coordinates (Top, Bottom, Left and Right) to move your element.  The position property takes four different values: static, relative, fixed, and absolute. This determines how the element will move on the page. Let's start with the easy peasy one: Static.</p><p>Static is your default position. It's how the page renders with no positioning set. It's just the way the HTML is naturally. You can't give it any directional coordinates. It just is.</p><img src="../imgs/static.png" alt="An image showing an example of static positioning. It reads Position: Static Elements fall in the normal flow of the page. Default. It's the non&ndash;position, position property.">
		    <p>Next up is fixed. Fixed is good for when you want to have an element stay where it is in the browser window regardless of scrolling. (Like say a navigation bar at the top of your page.) You can use directional positioning properties on a fixed element and it will just float over any content that runs behind it. So as you scroll down your page your fixed navigation bar will just float over the text and images on your page. Fixed position elements move in relation to the browser window. If you give your nav bar a top property of 50px, it will move 50px from the top of the browser window.</p><img src="../imgs/fixed.png" alt="An image showing an example of fixed positioning. It reads Position: Fixed Elements positioned in relation to the browser. Taken out of the normal flow of the page. Ignores scrolling.">
		    <h4>Warning: The next two are kind of a pain in the butt!</h4>
		    <p>Relative. When you set your directional properties on a relative element, it will move away from it's original position. So if you give your image a top: 50px declaration it will move down 50px from it's original position, not 50px down from the top of the browser window. Also, there will be an empty space where that element used to be.</p><img src="../imgs/relative.png" alt="An image showing an example of relative positioning. It reads Position: Relative Shifts Elements Looks at where element would have been and shifts it from that spot. Reserves the space where it would have been. Great companion to absolute">
		    <p>Absolute positioning. Elements with absolute positioning move relative to the nearest positioned parent element, except static elements. Example time! So if you have a div that's positioned relative and your image is inside of it when you give it an absolute position and a 50px top property, it will move 50px down from the relative div. If there is no positioned parent element it will move relative to the browswer window. It also can float over other content like fixed position elements can.</p><img src="../imgs/absolute1.png" alt="An image showing an example of relative positioning. It reads Position: Absolute Elements positioned in relation to it's parent element. Taken out of the flow of the page. Parent must be fixed, absolute, or relative."><img src="../imgs/absolute2.png" alt="An image of a browser window showing absolute positioning"><img src="../imgs/absolute3.png" alt="An image of a browser window showing absolute positioning.">
		    <p>Well, that's positioning in a nutshell. Thanks for reading thus far. Hopefully I'm not completely wrong in my understanding of positioning. If I am, feel free to shoot me a lengthy <a href="mailto:johanna.lonn@gmail.com">email</a> informing me of my wrongness.</p><p>Also much thanks to <a href="http://thewc.co/">The Women's Coding Collective</a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a> for letting me borrow (hijack) their images.</p>
