* What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I'm pretty familair with padding, borders and margins so this was more of a refresher for me. 

* What did you learn about CSS positioning?
So much!!! I never really understood CSS positioning, aside from fixed. (I would always use grid systems.) I'm finally starting to get how positioning works and feeling more comfortable using it. I still have a way to go though before I'm as comfortable with it as some of the other CSS rules. 

* What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The placement and layout was pretty easy for me. I had a hard time with the design. I was hung up on trying to make my site professional and what employers would want to see and I couldn't come up with anything I liked, so I scrapped that idea and just went with what I wanted. So yeah, it's totally not professional and probably hideous to some people but it makes me happy and I'm excited to build on it throughout Phase-0. :]

* What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
Again, I'm pretty solid on CSS. Child selectors make more sense to me now. I've never really used them before and now I'm kinda kicking myself for not exploring them more.
